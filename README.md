<h1>ANTHESIS</h1>

Anthesis is a digital plant avatar the can be displayed as a holographic illusion. The appearance of the flower avatar is determined by a series of questions posed to the viewer. The outcome of the questions is one the diagnosis as one of four archetypes. The archetypes all have different blooms who's appearance symbolizes aspects of the individual archetypes.

It is intended to provide an opportunity for self reflection as the viewer sees themselves represented symbolically in the blooming flower.

As a physical component to the experience, I am creating an Instructable project for a hologram viewer. As part of a proof of concept I created an installation for the incubator showcase using a monitor. Most screens work for use in a hologram viewer.
